<h1>Orphan pointing: manuscript precedent</h1>
<p>In Job 38:12, the Jerusalem Crown edition puts a פתח on no letter. The פתח floats before the ש of
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">שחר</span>. Although this is not the way μA or μL presents this
כתיב/קרי, there is manuscript precedent for such a floating presentation. This page presents some
examples of that precedent.</p>
<h2>2 Kings 4:7</h2>
<p>In 2 Kings 4:7, there is a קרי of <bdi lang="hbo">וּבָנַ֔יִךְ</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב of
<bdi lang="hbo">בניכי</bdi>.</p>
<p>This is hard to show in the “pointed כתיב” style of קרי/כתיב presentation favored by the
manuscripts. In such a style, the three diagonal קבוץ dots must float before the ב. The dots are
“orhpans”: they belong to no letter of the כתיב word. The first image below is from μA; the second
is from μL. The קבוץ dots are faint in μL, almost invisible. (They are under the ת of the previous
word.)</p>

<h2>Lamentations 4:16</h2>
<p>In Lamentations 4:16, there is a קרי of <bdi lang="hbo">וּזְקֵנִ֖ים</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב
of <bdi lang="hbo">זְקֵנִ֖ים</bdi>.</p>
<p>I.e. the three dots of the <span class="romanized">shuruq</span> are missing before the letter
זין. However, another manuscript (Sassoon 1053) has <bdi lang="hbo">ֻזְקֵנִ֖ים</bdi> — with a קבוץ
floating in the space before the word. This is another example of a vowel mark floating before a
כתיב word.</p>

<h2>2 Samuel 18:20</h2>
<p>2 Samuel 18:20 is a קרי ולא כתיב: the word <bdi lang="hbo">כֵּ֥ן</bdi> is read but not
written.</p>
<p>I.e. there is no space for the word <bdi lang="hbo">כֵּ֥ן</bdi> which is read but not written,
but the pointing (<span class="romanized">tsere</span>) and accent
(<span class="romanized">merkha</span>) were written between the words below. In other words, the
vowel and accent marks of a קרי word float in the space between the surrounding כתיב words.</p>
