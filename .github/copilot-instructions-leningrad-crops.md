# Procedure: μL (Leningrad) Cropping Help

When the user needs to crop a word from the Leningrad Codex (μL) Sefaria image:

1. **Read the quirkrec** to get the μL location: page, column, line, and the
   Hebrew word to find.

2. **Download the full Sefaria image:**
   ```
   https://manuscripts.sefaria.org/leningrad-color/BIB_LENCDX_F{page}.jpg
   ```
   (e.g., `F405B.jpg` for page 405B).

3. **Crop to the relevant quadrant** using Pillow. In a ~27-line, 2-column
   layout: column 1 = right half, column 2 = left half; top/bottom half is
   determined by line number (lines 1–14 ≈ top, 15–27 ≈ bottom). Save the
   crop to `.novc/`.

4. **Create a guide HTML page** in `.novc/` that shows:
   - Column number and which side (right/left)
   - Line number
   - The Hebrew word to look for (in a `dir=rtl` span)
   - The cropped image below the text

   Open this page with `Start-Process` so the user can locate the word.

5. **User takes screenshots** of the relevant portions at the desired zoom.

6. **Glue screenshots together** with Pillow at native resolution (no scaling)
   and save to `docs/jobn/img/{SID}.png`, replacing the existing image.

7. **Open the quirkrec detail page** via the local HTTP server so the user
   can verify the new image in context:
   ```
   Start-Process "http://localhost:8471/jobn/job1_full_list_details.html#row-{SID}"
   ```
