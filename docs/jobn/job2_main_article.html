<h1><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job was made in a bubble</h1>
<p>Like many students of Tanakh, I started out in the cult of <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. I
thought <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> was <b>the</b> definitive edition. Unlike many students
of Tanakh, I eventually soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It often fails to accurately transcribe μL (the Leningrad Codex).</li>
<li>It often fails to note where μL disagrees with other manuscripts.</li>
<li>It emphasizes manuscript quantity over quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>My first candidate for a <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> alternative was
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Biblia Hebraica Quinta). (Though I had soured on
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, I hadn’t escaped the broader cult of
<abbr class="small-caps">DBG</abbr>.)</p>
<p>But I soon soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> as well. I was dismayed to find that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> will not be complete for many years. Perhaps more importantly, I
found that <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> still suffers from some of the same problems as
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. Although <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> now emphasizes
manuscript quality over quantity, the other two problems listed above remain, albeit to a lesser
degree.</p>
<p>I continued my search for better editions, and I found some. This made me even more disappointed
with <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. It seems to have been made in a bubble: its editors seem
to have been unaware of or uninterested in relevant work done in other editions. I can see why
something like a fresh transcription of μL was beyond the scope of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. But I can’t see why <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> would
ignore the work already done in other editions, in particular the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The דעת מקרא (Da-at Miqra) series, particularly the volumes with sections called “הנוסח
ומקורותיו” (Breuer et al., 1970&thinsp;–&thinsp;2003).</li>
<li>Biblia Hebraica Leningradensia (<abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr>) (Dotan, 2001), particularly
its Appendix A (<abbr class="small-caps">BHL-A</abbr>).</li>
<li>The Westminster Leningrad Codex (<abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr>) (electronic) (editions
dating back to the 1980s).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Megilloth) came out in 2004. So, all
three of the above editions were available to the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors for
all fascicles of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>.</p>
<p>All volumes of דעת מקרא predate <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Megilloth. Other works by
Breuer are cited as sources in some fascicles of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, but the
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors seem to have been unaware of or uninterested in Breuer’s
relevant work in דעת מקרא.</p>
<p>Dotan’s <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> predates <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>
Megilloth. Dotan was even a consultant to the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> project. What’s
more, his <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> is cited as a source in many fascicles. So it is
puzzling that most of the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors seem to have been unaware of
or uninterested in his relevant work in <abbr class="small-caps">BHL-A</abbr>.</p>
<p>The editors of the some fascicles cite <abbr class="small-caps">BHL-A</abbr> in their
Introductions (Genesis, Leviticus, and Proverbs). Though aware of it, they were not interested in
it, at least not enough to have it deeply influence the apparatus. This represents a departure from
the strictly diplomatic editorial policy of <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. For better or for
worse, <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> aspired to transcribe (and often note) quirks in μL with
almost no quirk deemed irrelevant, as long as it could be captured in print. A good example is
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>’s transcription of געיה before vowel marks.</p>
<p>With <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, we now have an edition that is unevenly diplomatic. It
still transcribes (and often notes) most or all of the quirks that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> editors found relevant, plus a smattering of new ones. But many
quirks are not transcribed, and many that are transcribed are not noted. In a few fascicles, we know
that this unevenness is by design, as the editors refer the interested reader to
<abbr class="small-caps">BHL-A</abbr> for more information about the quirks in μL. Perhaps all
fascicles are uneven by design, i.e. uneven by editorial policy, and these are just the few that
happen to document it.</p>
<p><abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> has had various releases over its decades, many predating
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Megilloth. It is by far the most popular digital Hebrew Bible.
Plus, it is closely related to <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> and
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> was originally a
transcription of <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, and it carefully documents cases where it
diverges from <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> and/or <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. While
<abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> “cares” a lot about <abbr class="small-caps">DBG</abbr> Bibles,
the reverse seems to be false since the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors seem to have
been unaware of or uninterested in <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr>, whose notes are particularly
relevant to <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. This is puzzling since Alan Groves was intimately
involved in both the <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>
projects.</p>
<p>Although it may already be clear, I should explicitly state that my purposes are narrowly focused
on the Masoretic text. Thus I am not concerned with the many parts of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> that deal with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>witnesses in languages other than Hebrew</li>
<li>non-Masoretic (e.g. unpointed) Hebrew witnesses</li>
<li>Masorah magna and parva (other than קרי Mp)</li>
<li>the meaning of the text</li>
</ul>
<p>For all I know, those parts of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are of high quality. But those
parts are not my concern.</p>
<p>Having criticized <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> in general terms, I will now review the
specifics of the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Book of Job (2024). As of now (January 2026),
it is the latest fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> to be published and thus seems most
relevant to review, if only one fascicle is to be reviewed. I assume that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job is at least broadly representative of the
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> series so far, although each fascicle has a different primary
editor and may have different editorial teams working with that editor.</p>
<p>First, the good news: the Job fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> notes 7 quirks in
μL that are not noted in any of the three editions listed above. I.e. these are cases where
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> contributes something not available in any of those other three
editions. The contributions of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="grp_nbhq_and_x3.html">View 7 entries</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all of these contributions are new, i.e. not present in
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. I find some of these proposed transcriptions far-fetched, i.e.
unlikely to have been the scribe’s intention. Nonetheless, I consider even those ones to be valuable
contributions to the documentation of μL.</p>
<p>It is also good news that the Job fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> notes 11 quirks
in μL that <b>are</b> noted in one or more of the other three editions. I.e. these are cases where
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> reiterates something available in one or more of the other three
editions. While a reiteration is not as valuable as a new contribution, it is still valuable. Indeed
my main criticism of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job is that it should have reiterated most
of what can be found in those other three editions.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all but three of the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> reiterations are not
new, i.e. they were already present in <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. Indeed the other
editions’ source may be <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> in these cases. Nonetheless we refer to
all of them as reiterations by <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. (The three that are new are the
ones in 6:21, 18:4, and 19:16.) The reiterations made by <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are as
follows:</p>
<p><a href="grp_nbhq_and_n3.html">View 11 entries</a></p>
<p>Now for some mixed news: the Job fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> transcribes but
does not note 62 quirks in μL that are noted in one or more of the other three editions. We might
say that in these cases <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> merely implies the quirk, because it is
not explicit about it. (A note would be required to be explicit about it.) Those quirks implied by
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="grp_tbhq_and_n3.html">View 62 entries</a></p>
<p>Now for some bad news: the Job fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> does not
transcribe 33 quirks in μL that are noted in one or more of the other three editions. Not all such
missing transcriptions are a bad thing, as the other editions may occasionally propose
transcriptions that are far-fetched, i.e. unlikely to have been the scribe’s intention. But overall
these missing transcriptions reflect poorly on <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job. In all but
one case, a note is also lacking. (The one with a note is the one regarding מאום in 31:7, although
the note, too, is inaccurate.)</p>
<p><a href="grp_xbhq_and_n3.html">View 33 entries</a></p>
<p>I would not expect <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> to transcribe and/or note all the above
quirks. For example it would be reasonable for the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors to
find some of them unlikely to have been the scribe’s intention, for example finding some of them
more likely to have been an ink-mark made accidentally, or a mark not made by ink at all. It would
also be reasonable for the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> editors to find some of them likely
to have been the scribe’s intention, and therefore worthy of transcription, but differing from μA
and/or μY in ways too minor to note.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the quirks not transcribed and/or noted by <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are
of high quantity and high average quality. This strongly suggest that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>’s editors were either unaware of or uninterested in the other
three editions. I.e. it is unlikely that all these quirks were considered but rejected: it is more
likely that they were simply not considered at all. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that
8 of the 11 reiterations were already present in <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. The source of
these 8 reiterations is almost certainly <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, not one of the other
three editions.</p>
<p>Finally, we present some more bad news: some <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> notes help us
identify that the Job fascicle of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> transcribes but does not note
at least 32 quirks in μL that, <b>for good reason</b>, are not noted in any of the other three
editions. The good reason is that all of these are unlikely to be the scribe’s intention, i.e. are
more likely quirks in <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> than quirks in μL. These 32 likely-false
quirks can be divided into two groups: a group of 26 cases where <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>
has טרחא but should probably have דחי and a group of 6 cases not concerning a טרחא in
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>.</p>
<p>Here are the 26 cases noted in <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> where
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> has טרחא but should probably have דחי (note that 18:6 and 22:28
could also be considered to be in this group):</p>
<p><a href="grp_tbhq_and_zdw.html">View 26 entries</a></p>
<p>Then there are the 6 cases noted in <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> where
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> is probably in error but that error does not concern a טרחא in
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. (One of those 6, the one in 22:12 goes in the opposite
direction: <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> has דחי but should probably have טרחא.) Here are
those 6 cases:</p>
<p><a href="grp_tbhq_and_zmw.html">View 6 entries</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, by using the other three editions, we find the following about
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> contributes notes on 7 quirks not found in those
editions.</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> reiterates notes on 11 quirks found in those editions.</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> transcribes but does not note 62 quirks found in those
editions.</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> does not transcribe 33 quirks found in those editions.</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> transcribes but does not note at least 32 likely-false
quirks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Postscript 1: <abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr></h2>
<p>If <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job were being compiled today,
<abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr> (a fork of <abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr>) is another
edition that could help. But <abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr>’s Job changes (and their
accompanying notes) were made in 2022 and 2023, probably too late to be used by
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. Nonetheless, <abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr> is an edition
I would like to bring attention to. So, I would like to show the ways that
<abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr> might contribute to <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job if
it were being compiled today. I do so in the <a href="./job3_uxlc.html">document</a>,
“<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job: cases where <abbr class="small-caps">UXLC</abbr> could
have helped.”</p>
<h2>Postscript 2: quirks in μA</h2>
<p>Usually, μA agrees with the consensus. Indeed, where extant, it more or less <b>defines</b> the
consensus. Nonetheless, there are cases where it is μA rather than μL that diverges from the
consensus. It is unclear what <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job’s policy is regarding such
quirks in μA, but regardless of aspirational policy, in practice, I found no such notes in
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job. To me, it would make sense for
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> to note them, and therefore I note a few in the
<a href="./job4_quirks_in_mu_a.html">document</a>, “<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job: quirks
in μA.”</p>
