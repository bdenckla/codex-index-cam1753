<h1>Orphan pointing: manuscript precedent</h1>
<p>In Job 38:12, the Jerusalem Crown edition puts a פתח on no letter. The פתח floats before the ש of
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">שחר</span>. Although this is not the way μA or μL presents this
כתיב/קרי, there is manuscript precedent for such a floating presentation. This page presents some
examples of that precedent.</p>
<h2>2 Kings 4:7</h2>
<p>In 2 Kings 4:7 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?2Kings4:7">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/BD-2Kings.html#c4v7">M</a>), there is a קרי of
<bdi lang="hbo">וּבָנַ֔יִךְ</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב of <bdi lang="hbo">בניכי</bdi>.</p>
<p>This is hard to show in the “pointed כתיב” style of קרי/כתיב presentation favored by the
manuscripts. In such a style, three diagonal קובוץ dots float before the ב of
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">בניכי</span>. The dots are “orphans”: they belong to no letter of the
כתיב word.</p>
<p>Actually, they belong to no letter of the קרי word either! But they are understood to represent a
שורוק. Or, another way of looking at them is that they are understood to represent just a שורוק dot,
not the entire שורוק.</p>
<p>The first image below is from μA; the second is from μL. The קובוץ dots are faint in μL, almost
invisible. (They are under the ת of the previous word.)</p>

</p>
<p class="center"><img src="img/2Kings-c4v7.png" class="maxwidth50pc">
</p>
<p>My assumption is that a שורוק dot was not allowed to be an orphan for one or more of the
following reasons: (1) it is placed too high, i.e. not a below-mark, (2) it is too small, and (3) it
has too many other meanings (דגש and מפיק).</p>
<p>It is more common for a כתיב to lack a final שורוק than for it to lack initial שורוק. So, we see
this use of orphan קובוץ dots most often in cases where the כתיב lacks a final שורוק. An example is
found in 1 Samuel 12:10 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?1Samuel12:10">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/BA-1Samuel.html#c12v10">M</a>) where, in Tiberian
manuscripts, a pointed כתיב of <bdi lang="hbo">וַיֹּאמְרֻ֣</bdi> is paired with an unpointed קרי of
<bdi lang="hbo">ויאמרו</bdi>. In many printed editions, this would be shown as an unpointed כתיב of
<bdi lang="hbo">ויאמר</bdi> paired with a pointed קרי of <bdi lang="hbo">וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ</bdi>. Note
that this קובוץ marking is not really an orphan, since it belongs to the last letter of the word
(ר).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/UXLC-utils/wlc-a-notes/">this list of
<abbr class="small-caps">WLC</abbr> a-notes</a> for more examples. Also, that list shows many
examples where דגש is not allowed to be an orphan, supporting my claims as to why שורוק dot, too, is
not allowed to be an orphan.</p>
<h2>Lamentations 4:16</h2>
<p>In Lamentations 4:16 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Lamentations4:16">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/E3-Lamentations.html#c4v16">M</a>), there is a קרי
of <bdi lang="hbo">וּזְקֵנִ֖ים</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב of <bdi lang="hbo">זקנים</bdi>.</p>
<p>As in 2 Kings 4:7, the קובוץ dots must float before the first letter of the word, which in this
case is ז. Here is the way this word looks in Sassoon 1053:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="img/Sassoon-1053-Lamentations-c4v16.png" class="maxwidth50pc">
</p>
<p>(We provide an image from Sassoon 1053 rather than from μA and/or μL because μA is lost here and
μL does not use this (or any other) notation representing the שורוק dot in the קרי.)</p>
<h2>2 Samuel 18:20</h2>
<p>2 Samuel 18:20 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?2Samuel18:20">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/BB-2Samuel.html#c18v20">M</a>) is a קרי ולא כתיב:
the word <bdi lang="hbo">כֵּ֥ן</bdi> is read but not written, where by “not written” we mean not
written in formal texts. Such formal texts include the main columns of a Tiberian manuscript and the
text of an unpointed scroll.</p>
<p>So, in the main columns of a Tiberian manuscript, there are no letters
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">כן</span> on which to put the קרי pointing. This represents a more
extreme case of orphan קרי points than the previous two examples, since there is no word to which
the orphan points can “snuggle up” to. In other words, the vowel and accent marks of the קרי word,
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">כן</span>, float in the space between the surrounding כתיב words. Or
rather, the marks would float in that space if enough space had been left for them. As it is, they
somewhat awkwardly and confusingly reside beneath the ל.</p>
