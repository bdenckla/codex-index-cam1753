# jb22:12	רֹ֖אשׁ (has טרחא in WLC)
# It is now definitely a דחי in BHQ.
# It is ambiguous in 1997 BHS because of the conventions regarding mark
# placment under ר.
# It looks more like a דחי in 1984 BHS than in 1997 BHS.
# My guess is that the WLC editors read it as a דחי
# in whatever version of BHS they were looking at,
# but felt that טרחא was a better transcription of μL,
# and hence coded it as טרחא with a bracket-c note.
# So, the BHQ change (to unambiguous דחי) disagrees with WLC.
# So, the change in BHQ isn't really a change at all,
# if we take BHS to have what I think the WLC editors thought BHS
# had, namely, a דחי.
