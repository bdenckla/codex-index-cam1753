# Aleppo Codex Line Breaks

Determining where manuscript line breaks fall in the Aleppo Codex pages
that contain the Book of Job. (In manuscript studies this is sometimes
called "line-by-line alignment" of a text to a manuscript image.)

## Note on verification

Files in `py_ac_loc/` are **not** consumed by
`main_gen_misc_authored_english_documents.py`. Changes here do **not**
require running the generation script or checking `docs/` for changes.

## Folder layout

```
py_ac_loc/
  line-breaks/          ← flat-stream JSON files, one per page (the data)
  codex-index/          ← page index mapping leaves to verse ranges
  MAM-XML/              ← MAM-XML source files (Job.xml, Ps.xml, Prov.xml)
  gen_flat_stream.py    ← generates initial flat-stream JSON (no line markers)
  gen_line_break_editor.py  ← generates interactive HTML editor
  merge_line_markers.py ← merges edited line markers back, handling NFC normalization
  mam_xml_verses.py     ← low-level MAM-XML verse extraction (used by gen_flat_stream)
```

## Data format

Line-break data lives in `py_ac_loc/line-breaks/<page>.json`. Each file
is a flat JSON array (a "flat stream") containing:

- **Structural markers:** `{"page-start": "270v"}`, `{"page-end": "270v"}`
- **Verse markers:** `{"verse-start": "Job 1:16"}`, `{"verse-end": "Job 1:16"}`
- **Parashah markers:** `{"parashah": "spi-pe2"}`
- **Words:** plain Hebrew strings (maqaf-split)
- **Line markers:** `{"line-start": {"col": 1, "line-num": 1}}`,
  `{"line-end": {"col": 1, "line-num": 1}}`

A file without line markers is a starting point; one with them has had
line breaks defined.

## Page image sources

### archive.org direct image API (primary)

The full Aleppo Codex scan is at `https://archive.org/details/aleppo-codex`
(CC0 license, 593 pages). The direct image API URL is:

```
https://ia601801.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/7/items/aleppo-codex/Aleppo%20Codex_jp2.zip&file=Aleppo%20Codex_jp2/Aleppo%20Codex_{NNNN}.jp2&id=aleppo-codex&scale={S}&rotate=0
```

- `{NNNN}` = zero-padded page number (see leaf table below)
- `{S}` = scale factor: `1` = hi-res (~2.5 MB), `2` = medium (~800 KB)

For Job leaves (all past extra leaf 241a), the formula is:

```
N = (leaf_number - 1) × 2 + 2 + (0 for recto, 1 for verso)
```

### mgketer.org (secondary, chapter-based)

Useful for quick lookups but chapter-based, not page-based.

```
https://www.mgketer.org/mikra/29/{chnu}/1/mg/106
```

(Job = book 29, `chnu` = chapter number.)

277v    555   Job 29:14 – Job 31:6
278r    556   Job 31:7  – Job 32:7
278v    557   Job 32:8  – Job 33:33
279r    558   Job 34:1  – Job 35:10
279v    559   Job 35:10 – Job 37:9
280r    560   Job 37:9  – Job 38:30
280v    561   Job 38:31 – Job 40:5
281r    562   Job 40:6  – Job 41:22
281v    563   Job 41:23 – Prov 1:8
```

Two pages span book boundaries: 270r (Ps→Job) and 281v (Job→Prov).

## Workflow

### 1. Generate the flat stream (if not already present)

```
python .novc/gen_lb_flat_stream.py 270v
```

This creates `py_ac_loc/line-breaks/270v.json` with all words and
structural markers but no line-break markers. The script calls
`py_ac_loc/gen_flat_stream.py` internally.

### 2. Open the interactive editor

```
python py_ac_loc/gen_line_break_editor.py 270v 1
```

Arguments: `<page_id> <col>` where col 1 = right column, col 2 = left
column. The image is CSS-cropped to show only the relevant column (60%).

This generates `.novc/lb_editor_270v_col1.html` and opens it in the
browser. The editor shows:

- **Left panel (RTL):** Clickable Hebrew words with verse-start
  indicators and any pre-existing line-end markers.
- **Right panel:** Aleppo Codex page image from archive.org, cropped to
  the selected column.

Click the last word of each manuscript line to toggle a line-end marker.
The column selector sets which column number new markers get.
Line numbers auto-renumber per column.

### 3. Export and merge

Click **Export JSON to Clipboard**. The user will paste the exported
JSON into the chat. Save the pasted content to `.novc/edited_<page>.json`
and run the merge script:

```
python py_ac_loc/merge_line_markers.py <page_id>
```

This reads `.novc/edited_<page>.json` by default. The merge script
matches words by NFC-normalized comparison (the clipboard/chat pipeline
may normalize Hebrew strings) but preserves the original pristine
strings from the flat-stream source. It strips any pre-existing line
markers from the original before re-inserting the edited ones.

### 4. Repeat for the other column

Run the editor again with the other column number. The file already has
column 1 markers, so they will display as pre-existing markers while you
work on column 2.

## Line break heuristics

- Job's poetic sections are laid out in two columns (stichos-based).
- Early verses often fit **one verse per line**.
- Longer verses often span **two lines**, breaking at an etnachta or
  other major accent.
- Lines can break at a maqaf (the maqaf stays on the line).
- Parashah breaks (`{פ}`, `{ס}`) may cause blank lines.

## Pages with line breaks defined

| Page | Range | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 270r | Ps 149:1 – Job 1:16 | Done |
| 270v | Job 1:16 – Job 3:6 | Col 1 done (27 lines) |
| 278v | Job 32:8 – Job 33:33 | Done |
| 279r | Job 34:1 – Job 35:10 | Done |
| 279v | Job 35:10 – Job 37:9 | Done |
| 280r | Job 37:9 – Job 38:30 | Done |
| 280v | Job 38:31 – Job 40:5 | Done |
| 281r | Job 40:6 – Job 41:22 | Done |
| 281v | Job 41:23 – Prov 1:8 | Done |

All data is in `py_ac_loc/line-breaks/*.json`.

## Script promotion policy

When a script in `.novc/` turns out to be part of an ongoing,
repeatable workflow (not a one-time experiment), promote it to a
permanent location (e.g. `py_ac_loc/`) immediately. This avoids
re-creating it later and keeps the workflow self-contained. Suggest
promotion as soon as the pattern becomes clear.
