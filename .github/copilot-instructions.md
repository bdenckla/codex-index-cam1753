# General Copilot Instructions

## Unicode Character Preservation

This project uses typographically correct Unicode characters. **Never convert these to ASCII equivalents.**

### Characters to preserve:

- **Curly apostrophe:** `'` (U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) — not straight `'` (U+0027)
- **Curly quotes:** `"` (U+201C) and `"` (U+201D) — not straight `"` (U+0022)
- **Hebrew characters:** All Hebrew letters, vowel points, cantillation marks, and other marks must be preserved exactly

### When editing files:

1. Always read the file first to see what character style is used
2. Copy exact characters from existing content rather than retyping
3. When uncertain, use Python scripts with explicit `chr()` codes:
   - `chr(8217)` = `'` (curly apostrophe)
   - `chr(8220)` = `"` (left curly quote)
   - `chr(8221)` = `"` (right curly quote)
   - `chr(39)` = `'` (straight apostrophe — avoid)
   - `chr(34)` = `"` (straight quote — avoid)

### Hebrew Unicode ordering:

When working with Hebrew text, maintain the project's standard combining-mark
order within each base-letter cluster.  The authoritative implementation is
`pycmn/uni_denorm.py` (`give_std_mark_order`), a local copy from book-of-job,
and the CI-style checker is `check_mark_order.py` (also wired into
`check_all.py`).

The standard order places these four marks first (in this order), followed by
all other marks in their original relative order:

1. Shin dot (U+05C1)
2. Sin dot (U+05C2)
3. Dagesh / mapiq / shuruq dot (U+05BC)
4. Rafeh (U+05BF)

In practice this means: **base letter → shin/sin dot → dagesh → rafeh → vowels / meteg / accents** (the remaining marks keep whatever mutual order they already had).

When in doubt, pass the text through `give_std_mark_order` rather than
hand-ordering codepoints.

## Temporary Generated Files

Place any temporary generated files (scripts, HTML reports, debugging output, etc.) into the `.novc/` folder. This folder is excluded from version control.

## Running Python Code

**Always use the project venv Python** (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe`) when running scripts — never the bare `python` command, which may resolve to a system Python missing project dependencies.

**Never run Python one-liners via `python -c "..."` in the terminal.** These invariably fail due to character encoding and/or shell escaping issues, especially with Hebrew text. Instead, always create an actual `.py` file in `.novc/` and run it with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe .novc/<filename>.py`.

**Always set `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"` before running any Python command in PowerShell.** The Windows console defaults to cp1252, which cannot encode Hebrew characters and causes `UnicodeEncodeError` on any `print()` that includes Hebrew text. Set the variable once per terminal session before the first Python invocation.

**Running Black:** From the repo top directory, run:
```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m black .
```
Black respects `.gitignore` by default, so this covers all tracked Python files without needing an explicit glob.

## Installing Python Packages

**Never install packages to the system Python.** Always install into the project venv using `.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install <package>` (or ensure the venv is activated first). Add new dependencies to `requirements.txt` at the top level.

## Reading and Writing Python Files

When reading or modifying Python source files in this project:

**Writing/modifying Python (preserving comments):** Use **LibCST** when comments must be preserved:

```python
import libcst as cst

tree = cst.parse_module(source)

class MyTransformer(cst.CSTTransformer):
    def leave_Dict(self, original_node, updated_node):
        # Modify dict while preserving comments
        ...

modified = tree.visit(MyTransformer())
Path(file).write_text(modified.code)
```

LibCST preserves comments, whitespace, and formatting. Install with `pip install libcst`.

**Writing/modifying Python (simple cases):** For files without comments or where comment loss is acceptable, use the standard AST approach:

1. Parse with `ast.parse(source)`
2. Modify the AST (e.g., insert keys into `ast.Dict` nodes)
3. Generate code with `ast.unparse(tree)` (Python 3.9+)
4. Reformat with Black: `python -m black <file>`

⚠️ **Warning:** `ast.unparse()` discards all comments. Use LibCST if comments must be preserved.

Both approaches guarantee syntactically valid output. Avoid fragile regex-based or string-based text replacements.

## Screenshots

When the user refers to "the most recent screenshot" or similar, this means the most recent file (by last-write time) in:

```
C:\Users\BenDe\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots
```

## Column Coordinate Editing Workflow

To measure column positions on an Aleppo Codex page image:

1. **Generate the interactive HTML editor:**
   ```
   python py_ac_loc/gen_col_location_editor.py <page_id>
   ```
   This opens a browser editor with draggable side-midpoint handles and skew (rotation) controls for two columns of 28 lines each. If a coordinate file already exists for that page, it loads those values as defaults.

2. **Adjust columns** using handles, skew buttons (rotate ↶/↷), and fine mode. The "skew" label on the image shows which edge angle is being adjusted.

3. **Export JSON** by clicking the Export button (copies to clipboard).

4. **Paste the JSON into the chat.** The assistant saves it to `py_ac_loc/column-coordinates/<page_id>.json`.

5. **Pages for Book of Job:** 270r through 281v (24 pages total). Check which are done by listing `py_ac_loc/column-coordinates/`.

## Line Break Editing Workflow

To add line-break markers for an Aleppo Codex page:

1. **Generate the flat-stream JSON** (if it doesn't already exist in `py_ac_loc/line-breaks/`):
   ```
   python py_ac_loc/gen_lb_flat_stream.py <page_id>
   ```

2. **Generate the interactive HTML editor:**
   ```
   python py_ac_loc/gen_line_break_editor.py <page_id> <col>
   ```
   where col 1 = right column, col 2 = left column. This opens a browser
   editor with skinny/wide image crop toggle and a col 1/col 2 toggle,
   so both columns can be done in one session.

3. **Mark line breaks** in the editor by clicking the last word of each line, then click **Export**.

4. **Paste directly** into `py_ac_loc/line-breaks/<page_id>.json`, replacing its entire contents.

**Do NOT** paste the exported JSON into the chat window — that causes Unicode NFC normalization of Hebrew text. Pasting directly into the file preserves the original byte sequences and avoids the need for `merge_line_markers.py`.

## MAM with Doc URLs

See [copilot-instructions-mam-with-doc.md](.github/copilot-instructions-mam-with-doc.md) for how to construct URLs to the MAM with Doc online Hebrew Bible viewer (book codes, verse fragments, examples).

## Opening HTML Files

For the **interactive crop/preview editors** (`main_find_word_in_cam1753_images.py` and the cam1753 crop editor in book-of-job), always serve over HTTP via the built-in `serve_and_open()` helper. These editors use `navigator.clipboard`, `canvas.toBlob()`, and cross-origin image access, all of which require a secure context and fail under `file://`. Plain `http://127.0.0.1` is treated as a secure context by all major browsers, so TLS is not needed.

For editors that only use JSON-to-clipboard export (no canvas/download), opening directly as a `file://` URL is acceptable.

For simple, read-only HTML files that only display static content (no clipboard API, no canvas export), opening directly as a file (`Start-Process "path/to/file.html"`) is fine.

## Authorship Marking

When generating a new version-controlled file (Python script, Markdown doc, etc.), include an authorship comment as the **first line**:

- **Python:** `# Initially generated by GitHub Copilot.`
- **Markdown/HTML:** `<!-- Initially generated by GitHub Copilot. -->`

This does not apply to throwaway files in `.novc/`.

## Git Discipline

- **Never auto-commit.** Only commit when the user explicitly asks.
- **Always use fresh commits.** Never use `git commit --amend` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Before discarding work** (`git reset`, `git checkout -- .`, `git stash drop`, etc.): always run `git status` and `git diff --stat` first. If there are uncommitted changes beyond the current experiment, alert the user and ask them to commit or stash before proceeding.
- **Before a series of experiments** that might need to be thrown away: ask the user to commit the current clean state first, so there is a safe baseline to return to.

## Markdown formatting

- **Avoid strikethrough:** Do not use bare tildes (`~`) as an
  abbreviation for "approximately." Markdown renderers interpret text
  between two `~` characters as strikethrough. Instead, write out
  "approx." or "approximately," or escape the tilde (`\~`).
