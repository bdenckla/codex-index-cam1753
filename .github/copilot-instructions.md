# General Copilot Instructions

## Unicode Character Preservation

This project uses typographically correct Unicode characters. **Never convert these to ASCII equivalents.**

### Characters to preserve:

- **Curly apostrophe:** `'` (U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) — not straight `'` (U+0027)
- **Curly quotes:** `"` (U+201C) and `"` (U+201D) — not straight `"` (U+0022)
- **Hebrew characters:** All Hebrew letters, vowel points, cantillation marks, and other marks must be preserved exactly

### When editing files:

1. Always read the file first to see what character style is used
2. Copy exact characters from existing content rather than retyping
3. When uncertain, use Python scripts with explicit `chr()` codes:
   - `chr(8217)` = `'` (curly apostrophe)
   - `chr(8220)` = `"` (left curly quote)
   - `chr(8221)` = `"` (right curly quote)
   - `chr(39)` = `'` (straight apostrophe — avoid)
   - `chr(34)` = `"` (straight quote — avoid)

### Hebrew Unicode ordering:

When working with Hebrew text, maintain the project's standard combining-mark
order within each base-letter cluster.  The authoritative implementation is
`pycmn/uni_denorm.py` (`give_std_mark_order`), a local copy from book-of-job,
and the CI-style checker is `check_mark_order.py` (also wired into
`check_all.py`).

The standard order places these four marks first (in this order), followed by
all other marks in their original relative order:

1. Shin dot (U+05C1)
2. Sin dot (U+05C2)
3. Dagesh / mapiq / shuruq dot (U+05BC)
4. Rafeh (U+05BF)

In practice this means: **base letter → shin/sin dot → dagesh → rafeh → vowels / meteg / accents** (the remaining marks keep whatever mutual order they already had).

When in doubt, pass the text through `give_std_mark_order` rather than
hand-ordering codepoints.

## Project Overview

This repo (`codex-index-cam1753`) is a digital scholarship tool for locating
Hebrew words on photographed pages of Cambridge University Library MS Add. 1753.
The current focus is on the Book of Job, though the infrastructure supports
arbitrary biblical books.

### Pipeline stages:

1. **MAM-XML Parsing** — `py_mam_xml/mam_xml_verses.py` extracts word lists from `MAM-XML/`
2. **Flat Stream** — `gen_cam1753_flat_stream.py` combines explicit verse-range args + MAM-XML into per-page word streams; data in `cam1753-line-breaks/`
3. **Line-Break Annotation** — human-in-the-loop via `gen_cam1753_line_break_editor.py`; data in `cam1753-line-breaks/`
4. **Column Coordinates** — `gen_col_quad_editor.py`; data in `cam1753-col-quads/`
5. **Word Lookup** — `main_find_word_in_cam1753_images.py` ties it all together

### Naming conventions:

- **Page IDs:** `{spread_number}{A|B}` — e.g., `0073A` (spread 73, left page), `0073B` (spread 73, right page)
- **Column numbering:** col 1 = right column (read first in RTL), col 2 = left column
- **Lines per column:** 26

### Sibling repo:

`codex-index-aleppo` covers the same biblical text in the Aleppo Codex.
It uses rectangular (harp/fanout) column geometry instead of this repo’s quadrilateral geometry.

## Temporary Generated Files

Place any temporary generated files (scripts, HTML reports, debugging output, etc.) into the `.novc/` folder. This folder is excluded from version control.

## Running Python Code

**Always use the project venv Python** (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe`) when running scripts — never the bare `python` command, which may resolve to a system Python missing project dependencies.

**Never run Python one-liners via `python -c "..."` in the terminal.** These invariably fail due to character encoding and/or shell escaping issues, especially with Hebrew text. Instead, always create an actual `.py` file in `.novc/` and run it with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe .novc/<filename>.py`.

**Always set `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"` before running any Python command in PowerShell.** The Windows console defaults to cp1252, which cannot encode Hebrew characters and causes `UnicodeEncodeError` on any `print()` that includes Hebrew text. Set the variable once per terminal session before the first Python invocation.

**Running Black:** From the repo top directory, run:
```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m black .
```
Black respects `.gitignore` by default, so this covers all tracked Python files without needing an explicit glob.

## Installing Python Packages

**Never install packages to the system Python.** Always install into the project venv using `.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install <package>` (or ensure the venv is activated first). Add new dependencies to `requirements.txt` at the top level.

## Python Package `__init__.py` Style

Keep `__init__.py` files **minimal** — they exist only as package markers so that explicit submodule imports work (e.g. `from py_cam1753_word_image.page import ...`). Do **not** add re-exports to `__init__.py`; always import directly from the submodule that defines the symbol.

## Global Variables

Avoid the `global` keyword and avoid mutating module-level variables. If a function needs shared state, pass it as a parameter or return it. Module-level constants (ALL_CAPS) are fine as long as they remain immutable after definition.

## Reading and Writing Python Files

When reading or modifying Python source files in this project:

**Writing/modifying Python (preserving comments):** Use **LibCST** when comments must be preserved:

```python
import libcst as cst

tree = cst.parse_module(source)

class MyTransformer(cst.CSTTransformer):
    def leave_Dict(self, original_node, updated_node):
        # Modify dict while preserving comments
        ...

modified = tree.visit(MyTransformer())
Path(file).write_text(modified.code)
```

LibCST preserves comments, whitespace, and formatting. Install with `pip install libcst`.

**Writing/modifying Python (simple cases):** For files without comments or where comment loss is acceptable, use the standard AST approach:

1. Parse with `ast.parse(source)`
2. Modify the AST (e.g., insert keys into `ast.Dict` nodes)
3. Generate code with `ast.unparse(tree)` (Python 3.9+)
4. Reformat with Black: `python -m black <file>`

⚠️ **Warning:** `ast.unparse()` discards all comments. Use LibCST if comments must be preserved.

Both approaches guarantee syntactically valid output. Avoid fragile regex-based or string-based text replacements.

## Screenshots

When the user refers to "the most recent screenshot" or similar, this means the most recent file (by last-write time) in:

```
C:\Users\BenDe\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots
```

## MAM with Doc URLs

See [copilot-instructions-mam-with-doc.md](.github/copilot-instructions-mam-with-doc.md) for how to construct URLs to the MAM with Doc online Hebrew Bible viewer (book codes, verse fragments, examples).

## Opening HTML Files

For the **interactive crop/preview editors** (`main_find_word_in_cam1753_images.py` and the cam1753 crop editor in book-of-job), always serve over HTTP via the built-in `serve_and_open()` helper. These editors use `navigator.clipboard`, `canvas.toBlob()`, and cross-origin image access, all of which require a secure context and fail under `file://`. Plain `http://127.0.0.1` is treated as a secure context by all major browsers, so TLS is not needed.

For editors that only use JSON-to-clipboard export (no canvas/download), opening directly as a `file://` URL is acceptable.

For simple, read-only HTML files that only display static content (no clipboard API, no canvas export), opening directly as a file (`Start-Process "path/to/file.html"`) is fine.

## Authorship Marking

When generating a new version-controlled file (Python script, Markdown doc, etc.), include an authorship comment as the **first line**:

- **Python:** `# Initially generated by GitHub Copilot.`
- **Markdown/HTML:** `<!-- Initially generated by GitHub Copilot. -->`

This does not apply to throwaway files in `.novc/`.

## Git Discipline

- **Never auto-commit.** Only commit when the user explicitly asks.
- **Always use fresh commits.** Never use `git commit --amend` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Before discarding work** (`git reset`, `git checkout -- .`, `git stash drop`, etc.): always run `git status` and `git diff --stat` first. If there are uncommitted changes beyond the current experiment, alert the user and ask them to commit or stash before proceeding.
- **Before a series of experiments** that might need to be thrown away: ask the user to commit the current clean state first, so there is a safe baseline to return to.

## Markdown formatting

- **Avoid strikethrough:** Do not use bare tildes (`~`) as an
  abbreviation for "approximately." Markdown renderers interpret text
  between two `~` characters as strikethrough. Instead, write out
  "approx." or "approximately," or escape the tilde (`\~`).
