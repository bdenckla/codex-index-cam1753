## Page-split naming convention

The archive.org images are two-page spreads (the codex photographed while
open). Each spread shows the verso (B side) of one leaf on the right and
the recto (A side) of the next leaf on the left — as if the codex is
actually spread open.

The split files in `cam1753-page-splits/` are named `{leaf:04d}{side}.jpg`
where side is `A` (recto) or `B` (verso). The leaf number is derived from
the numbering visible on the left page of each spread:

- The left page of archive page N bears leaf number N − 4.
- The right page is the verso of the preceding leaf, i.e. leaf N − 5.

For example, archive page 0077 yields `0072B.jpg` (right) and `0073A.jpg`
(left).

The leaf numbers on the manuscript pages appear both in Western Arabic
numerals written in pencil (e.g. "73") and in Hebrew numerals
(e.g. "עג").
