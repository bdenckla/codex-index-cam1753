<h1>BHQ Job: Not quite modern</h1>
<p>Like many students of Tanakh, I started out in the cult of <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. I
thought <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> was <b>the</b> definitive edition. Unlike many students
of Tanakh, I eventually soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It often fails to accurately transcribe μL (the Leningrad Codex).</li>
<li>It often fails to note where μL disagrees with other manuscripts.</li>
<li>It cites other manuscripts using an outdated emphasis on quantity over quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>My first candidate for a <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> alternative was
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Biblia Hebraica Quinta). (Though I had soured on
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, I still hadn’t fully escaped its cult.)</p>
<p>But I soon soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> as well. One obvious problem is that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> will not be complete for many years. Perhaps more importantly, I
found that <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> still suffers from some of the same problems as
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. Although <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> now emphasizes
manuscript quality over quantity, the other two problems listed above remain, albeit to a lesser
degree.</p>
<p>As I continued my search for better editions, I found editions that do much better. This made me
even more disappointed with <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, in retrospect. I can see why
something like a fresh transcription of μL was beyond the scope of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. But I can’t see why <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> would
neglect the work already done in other editions. These other editions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>דעת מקרא (Breuer et al., 1970&thinsp;–&thinsp;2003)</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> (Dotan, 2001)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first volume of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Megilloth) came out in 2004. The חמש
מגילות volume of דעת מקרא came long before, in 1990. Even Dotan’s
<abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> was available in plenty of time to be used in all volumes of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. Before his death, Dotan was even a consultant for
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. What’s more, his <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> is even
used as a source in at least some volumes of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. So it is
particularly puzzling that his <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr>, in particular its monumental
Appendix A, was not used (or was not thoroughly used) in <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>.</p>
<p>Although it may already be clear, at this point I should mention that my purposes are narrowly
focused on the Masoretic text. Thus I am not concerned with the many parts of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> that deal with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sources in languages other than Hebrew</li>
<li>non-Masoretic (e.g. unpointed) Hebrew sources</li>
<li>Masorah magna and parva</li>
<li>the meaning of the text</li>
</ul>
<p>For all I know, these parts of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are of the highest quality,
and improve greatly on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. But these parts are not my concern.</p>
<p>Having criticized <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> in general terms, I will now review the
specifics of the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Book of Job. As of now, it is the latest volume
of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> to be published. Right now the review consists merely of this
<a href="./job1_overview.html">document</a>, “Book of Job (ספר איוב) Document 1 - Overview.”</p>
