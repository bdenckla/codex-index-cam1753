Perhaps in some manuscripts, the angle of these marks can help make this distinction, but μL is not such a manuscript. We can, as usual, lean on consensus for help, although consensus based on manuscript evidence is hard to determine in these cases due to this same problem of angle-reliability mentioned above. Notably, I suspect that μA is more reliable than μL in this regard, but I am not sure. So, in these cases, in determining consensus, we may have to rely more than usual on the evidence of printed editions. We may also have to rely more than usual on context like the grammar of cantillation, to determine which of these marks is most likely in a given situation. Aside: the מקף is very faint."
